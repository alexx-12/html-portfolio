<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Alexandra Michaella R. Sabas, and I’m 22 years old. I was born on December 22, 2002,
and I currently live in Sta. Maria, Bulacan. I’m a graduating BSIT student at Bulacan State University.
One of my biggest passions is fashion, and I love expressing myself through my outfits. 
I enjoy posting OOTDs and sharing my personal style with others.</p>

<p>Aside from fashion, I am also a musician. I am a proud clarinet player and a member of Banda 31 Original of
  Sta. Maria Inc.. Music runs in my family, and I’ve been playing for almost eight years. 
  Before that, I was also a majorette when I was a kid. Being part of a band has been a significant part of my life,
  allowing me to connect with my roots and share my love for music.</p>

<p>I also have an active lifestyle and a strong passion for sports, especially volleyball.
  I started playing in high school and competed in events like BulPriSe, representing my school
  from elementary to high school. Sports have helped me stay disciplined, motivated, and focused on my goals.</p>
